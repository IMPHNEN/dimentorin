# Dimentorin - AI-Powered Learning Platform

> *"Education is not preparation for life; education is life itself."* - John Dewey

## 🌟 Vision

Dimentorin revolutionizes online education by creating a decentralized, AI-driven learning ecosystem where knowledge flows freely between learners and creators. Our platform combines the power of blockchain technology with artificial intelligence to deliver personalized learning experiences while ensuring content quality and creator incentives.

## 🎯 Abstract

A purely peer-to-peer version of the educational platform would allow online learning and content creation to be shared directly from one participant to another without going through a centralized institution. AI-generated roadmaps provide personalized learning paths, while digital signatures and token incentives offer a solution to ensure content quality. We propose a system for learning transactions that combines blockchain's immutability with artificial intelligence's adaptability.
